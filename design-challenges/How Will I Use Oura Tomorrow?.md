How Will I Use Oura Tomorrow?
-----------------------------

My favorite product in the world is the [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com) and its accompanying app. Why? My love is well justified:

1.  _It's holistic._ Oura monitors my body's data; it goes beyond tracking steps and actually tracks sleep, respiratory rate, RHR and HRV and calculates performance level based on those inputs.

2.  _It's subtle, elegant, beautiful.  AND, it lasts._ As opposed to clunky watches, bands, HRV belts, this is a beautifully designed ring that can double for a wedding band (mine does! :). At the same time, the ring is made to take the worst kind of beating - I don't even take it off when I dive, rock climb or lift weights.

3.  _It's accurate._ The ring uses infrared light which penetrates arteries in your finger. This approach makes your sleep reading much more accurate than anything else on the market.

Needless to say, I use this thing every day. It's a piece of beloved jewelry. The app is the first thing I check in the morning - searching for a dopamine hit, I study my sleep quality metrics.


**Sometimes I think about Oura so much that I fantasize what it would be like to do product with them.** I imagine it would be something like this...
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;   
## Step One: Identify Improvement Goal

To focus this exercise, I limited the scope of the improvement to the app experience (vs. hardware) and sleep data only (vs. activity). The goal I chose was:

**Increase meaningful user engagement with the product as a proxy to improving sleep quality.**

I chose this goal because it greatly aligns with the company's mission statement. Additionally, Oura's user base has increased significantly in the last 2 years; at this stage of the company's development, driving value to new and existing users is critical.¬†

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Step Two: Segment Users

It's difficult to improve the app experience for everyone at once. Instead, we want to zero-in on a specific user persona. I used psychographic segmentation to help me prioritize a segment of Oura users that would benefit most from the improvement:

**1.  Sports Professionals**

-   Coaches, professional players, biohackers

-   On the cutting edge of optimizing their health, continuously testing new technologies to help them track health outcomes

**2.  Amateurs**

-   Weekend warriors, prioritizing at least one health activity (fitness, meditation, good sleep or healthy diet) per day

-   Want to improve health outcomes but not single-mindedly focused on this goal

**3.  New Year Resolutionists**

-   Care about their health but does not prioritize healthy habits on a daily basis

I'm assuming amateurs represent the largest user segment among existing Oura users, followed by professionals. **Based on the size of the user base and therefore highest expected impact, we should prioritize the Amateur group for our improvement.**
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Step Three: Understand User Needs and Problems

**Quantifying your sleep != better sleep**

_User Problem #1_ What does sleep score of 91 mean? How does it compare to 82? What does it mean for my day?¬†

_User Problem #2:_ Ok, I know my sleep score - how can I improve it?¬† The number changes every day but I don't know why. It's hard to connect my actions to the number.¬†

Since there are already a few solutions within Oura to User Problem #1 (FAQs, Blog, Instructional text within the app), I would like to focus on Problem #2 and brainstorm a few solutions to the problem next. 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Step Four: Brainstorm Solutions

_Idea 1._ ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sleep Coach: help Amateurs hire a sleep coach via the app to help improve their sleep score

_Idea 2._ üîü Experiments: enable self-guided tools for running experiments on known drivers of bad sleep (e.g How does caffeine affect my sleep?)

_Idea 3._ ‚õëÔ∏è Helping Hands Forum: help amateurs connect with Oura's super users to seek advice on how to interpret and improve their sleeping scores

**Prioritizing Solutions:**

**Based on Impact VS Difficulty, idea #2 presents the biggest opportunity,** where the potential estimated impact is larger than the difficulty of implementation.

## Implementation Notes:

**Initial Drafts of Mockups:**

We'd also need a special tag in tags dedicated to this effort, and a whole new section in Trends.

**Metrics:**

Ultimately, we want to align with our top level goal - to increase meaningful user engagement with the product¬† so that we can help users improve their sleep quality. Here's the funnel we should track to evaluate the success of the feature:

-   % of active users click on the experiment feature/day¬†
-   % of users who click on the feature that end up setting up one experiment
-   Number of days recorded in the experiment (days that had a relevant tag added)¬†
-   % of users who set up the experiment that end up finishing the experiment
-   % of users who have completed more than one experiment

**Risks - Implementing Idea #2:**

Final Thoughts
--------------

Through this exercise I came up with an Experiments idea for a new Oura feature. I think it would add so much value to my life that I want to start doing this on my own. I can create my own tag, and then massage my sleep data to see if I can spot a correlation. I prepped my spreadsheet - I will start doing this tomorrow! :)
