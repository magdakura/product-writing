## Prompt
Imagine you are on the team responsible for putting together the roadmap of product enhancements and innovations at Macy's website and/or app.

What are the top 3 ideas you'd like to suggest for further investigation?  Why did you choose these 3?

* * * * *

## Goal of improvement

**Regain and retain the millennial customer**

**Why?**

-   Millennials is the largest living adult generation (surpassed Baby Boomers!) and we are on the cusp of our prime spending years. 

-   It's no secret that Macy's has struggled to attract and retain millennials.

_PSAs:_

-   Making lots of assumptions based on my personal experience and cursory industry research

-   Limiting this exercise to apparel, only

## First things first, know your customer

**Millennials care:**

-   About novel experiences and compelling stories, more than things

-   Authenticity

-   Sustainability

-   Natural and high-quality products

**Millennials want:**

-   Convenience

-   Ease

-   Flexibility

-   Good Deal

-   Surprise and delight

-   Local

One misconception is that physical retail is dead for millennials. This is not true, but in-person shopping has to be trip-worthy and provide a delightful experience (REI, Whole Foods, Ikea).

## User problems along the user journey

**As a Millennial:**

1.  I don't think of Macy's as my immediate place to shop, unless I'm already in a shopping mall

2.  I hate the idea of "trip to the mall" - it's inconvenient, time consuming and stressful.  It's an unpleasant experience to all my senses. 

3.  The amount of items is overwhelming. It's hard to find something that suits me.

4.  Customer Service feel like "Store Service" where they exist to help the store look good, but not help me get something that makes me look good

5.  If I find something I like, I'm not sure I'm getting the best deal, so I have to do additional research

## Opportunity

How might we reframe Macy's in millennial's mind as a destination to find exactly what they are looking for?

Design Principles

-   Focus on delivering some of the same standards that originally made Macy's successful - convenient, tailored and novel offerings supported by excellent customer service. 

-   The ultimate solution should leverage Macy's unique strengths: enormous inventory of apparel and strong data driven culture.

## Brainstorming Ideas

**1.  Fashion coach**

-   Initial online video chat OR in-store meeting where you chat through style preferences

-   E.g. Source fashion coaches from IG to an fashion ambassador program

-   Receive your first box proposal where you can swap items until you're satisfied with the choices

-   Receive your personalized clothes box at your own home or have a box waiting for you at your local store

-   Receive personalized recommendations from your coach from new inventory

-   You can refresh your closet every 3 months

-   Receive new clothes once a quarter and try on in the comfort of your home before making a purchase decision.

-   Get one of a kind, special design clothes, just for members

**2.  Recreate "this look" (app feature or browser extension)**

-   Upload a photo with an outfit you like

-   Feature generates a list of items "like this" that you can save to your list, share and buy later

**3.  Outfit creator**

-   Browse user-created outfits - filterable by hight, size and body type

-   Create your avatar - upload a face shot, choose a hairstyle and enter your body measurements. 

-   Try things on, include comments, share

## Prioritization
| **Idea**      | **Solves Problem?**.              |  **Impact**.                                            | **Difficulty**                                                                                |
| -----------   | -----------                       | -----------                                             | -----------                                                                               |
| Fashion Coach | Yes, hand picked list just for me.|_M._ Some will not want to meet with a person to discuss | _L._  Low build but complex to execute - Coaches would have to be sourced, trained & hired|
| Recreate This Look     | Yes, I know what I like when I see it. Helping me find exactly what I want! | _L._ | _L._ Leverage "more like this" feature & data and image recognition libraries.
| Outfit Creator | Yes, provided that a library of body types similar to mine already exists. | _S._ Works great for outliers (e.g. giant people like myself) but maybe not so interesting for more "normal" body sizes/ types. | _L_ Initial Sourcing and Building Creator Tools.


**Based on a simple, Impact VS Difficulty matrix, I think that "Recreate This Look" has the most potential.**

Fun fact: Did you know that Macy's was the first company to promote a woman to an executive position back in 1860s? (Margaret Getchell)


## Execution 

Assuming we decided to experiment with "Recreate This Look" feature, we'd want to:

1.  Validate Impact
2.  Validate Feasilibity
3.  Build and Validate Prototype
4.  Build MVP

## Validating Problem and Impact

**User research:** what are the reasons why users abandon without adding anything to the cart?

**Painted door test:** Question to users who spend "above average" time in the app without adding anything to the cart:

Do you have a picture of the outfit you're looking for? 

-   YES 
-   NO

Would you like us to recreate it?

-   YES (Thanks! We're working on a feature that will soon allow you to do this. Stay tuned!)
-   NO

## Building and Validating the Prototype

1.  As a user, I'm able to upload a photo of an outfit I love
2.  As a user, I'm able to browse the result - inventory of items that match the outfit in the photo
3.  As a user, I'm able to add the items from the feature to cart

## MVP Prioritization

User stories 1-3 are critical to the success of this feature.

**Risks:**

-   Efficacy - if my photos generate 0 results, I will not come back to use it

-   Accuracy - if my photos generate incorrect results, I will not come back to use it

**Future enhancements:**

-   Library of previously uploaded outfits

-   Web app extension where I'm able to take a screenshot that immediately saves in my Macy's account under "Recreate This Look"
