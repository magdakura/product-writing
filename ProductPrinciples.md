Summary
-------

Product principles are simply **heuristics for decision-making** that help the product team make **consistent decisions**, especially as the product team scales. 

The most common approach toward defining principles is to identify ideals to which the team commits, generally in a series of brainstorming workshops. However, this approach is problematic because:

1.  High-level truths are difficult to understand without concrete examples, 
2.  Deeply-held values are subject to interpretation, and 
3.  Ideals rarely survive the test of reality.

**There is an alternative, bottom-up approach to developing principles**, in which the team:

1.  Develops a habit of recording daily product decisions,
2.  Engages in active peer reflection, and
3.  Begins to recognize patterns in decisions, which represent foundational blocks of Product Principles.

Relevant Behavioral Research
----------------------------

If we assume that principles are simply shortcuts for decision-making, then it's useful to understand the basics of behavioral research, which is the study of the many variables that impact the formation of one's habits.

The human brain receives thousands of sensory data per minute, all of which require processing to arrive at a decision - the answer to the question "What next?" The brain processes this information by recognizing known objects and identifying patterns based on previous experience. Whitehead and Finkelstein (2009) describe this scanning process as "pattern recognition," in which a brain makes assumptions based on prior experiences and judgments and assigns "emotional shortcut tags" to each memory. These patterns and their emotional imprints enable us to intuitively understand presented information, ascribe meaning, and make efficient decisions. In our craft, this is what we call "product intuition" or "good judgement," and it's totally trainable. 

As explained by psychologist Gary Klein and popularized later by Malcolm Gladwell in his bestselling book "Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking," these mental models are developed through constant repetition, which creates connections among the billions of neurons in the brain. The more frequently a particular series of synapses fire together, the smoother that neural path becomes, and the more likely that mental map is to be found and used in the future.

Step 1: Decision Log
--------------------

If we can dissect what makes good decisions good, then we can extrapolate those heuristics to principles and teach, using real examples, shortcuts to good decision-making that are consistent with our values and previous actions.

The first step in this process is understanding the current state of our decision-making, which is a process familiar to Product Managers who often start here with product discovery. We can use a simple spreadsheet to log decisions we make on a daily basis and take stock of the heuristics we might already have for our decision-making.

### This spreadsheet should be:

1.  Publicly accessible for anyone to enter their ideas, and 
2.  Easy to fill out.

As James Clear describes in his book "Atomic Habits," you must make a new habit easy enough so that you don't need motivation to do it. 

> Make it so easy you can't say no. ---Leo Babauta

Also, this spreadsheet should not contain any judgements about shorthand, grammar mistakes, or incomplete ideas. Quantity is more important than quality.

Step 2: The Crit
----------------

"The Crit" is an art school term that describes the critique session, in which a student's artwork is evaluated by a group of their peers and professors. A student presents their work, and the group responds with feedback: comments, questions, cheers, and tears. Athletes have a similar practice in which they dissect, with teammates and coaches, every one of their moves in the game. 

I have always wondered why we don't have a similar practice in the professional world. This practice helps you deliberately improve and, if done frequently, can lead to mastery of any skill. It sheds light on many hidden traps of decision-making ([HBR](https://hbr.org/1998/09/the-hidden-traps-in-decision-making-2)) like the status-quo trap or the confirming-evidence trap, in which we seek out information in a way that supports our prior decisions. It is also a good practice for experienced professionals, as old mental models may have blindspots when the context changes. My hero, Anders Ericsson, a cognitive psychologist who demystified how expertise is acquired, studied physicians who were unable to diagnose unusual heart and lung diseases because they encountered them so rarely that they forgot that these diseases were a real possibility. In other words, their smooth neural pathways favored the most common scenario and forgot about the rest. 

**The goal of this peer feedback session is to think critically through tradeoffs and prioritization heuristics as a group.** The exercise must be inquisitive, blameless, and objective. Some questions to facilitate the critique are as follows:

-   What alternatives did you consider? What were the tradeoffs?
-   Are there any other perspectives on the assumptions that were made? 
-   What suffered in this decision? Was that important? Why not? 

The group should meet weekly to discuss decisions, but we don't have to discuss every decision that was made. It should be obvious which decision was the most important - and, obviously, bad decisions are easy examples for discussion. 

### There are two tangible outputs of The Crit: 

1.  Bottom-line prioritization statement for the decisions discussed. 
2.  Vote on whether, as a team, we think this was the right decision.

Step 3: Product Principles
--------------------------

Over time, you should start seeing patterns in the heuristics that your team believes lead to good decisions and the questions that matter in decision-making. Those are your product principles. You might also see things you never want to do - for example, disrespecting your staff's scheduled vacation time unless it's an absolute emergency. Those are your red lines. Now, you also have a team that understands why we believe that these values matter and a treasure trove of real-life examples in which the ideals survived the test of reality.
